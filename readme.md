# checkif

A easy to use CLI tool that allows you make advanced checking (specially on Windows)

## Why

The windows CMD (at least Win 7) is very inconsistent:
- Commands that runs if previous was success or not (`a && b || c`) works just in a batch file
- Cannot check inline in a CMD
  - If text exists in /is the content
  - File/dir exists
  - Check multiple files and expect at least some succeeds
